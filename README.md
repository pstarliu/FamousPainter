# FamousPainters
A small project to help me getting started with Typescript, it is the final project for DEV201x Introduction to TypeScript from edX. 

It is created using Visual Stduio 2013 using Typescript with Jquery and Bootstrap. The only tricky part is getting 
Bootstrap working wih requirejs and Jquery.
